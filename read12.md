### 1. PINPOINT YOUR VALUES

To investigate what’s truly important
to you, answer the questions below
(expanded from a set in Life Reimagined,
Berrett-Koehler, 2013). Take your time.
Go from your gut. And write them down
on the back.

#### 1. What motivates me to get up in the morning?

I like to wake up to make a difference. It might just be feeding my cat or saying hi to my firends online: feeling connected and contributing makes me feel good.

#### 3. What am I doing when I’m at my best?

Coding wise im styling or learning a new way to do my job faster, in my private life i love being there for friends.

#### 4. Why am I bothered by what bothers me?

Because like everyone else i have a set of personal values.

#### 5. Why do I do the work I do?

Because i want to: i wouldnt bother otherwise

#### 6. Why do I live where I live?

I chose to.

#### 7. Why do I buy what I buy?

My values.

#### 8. Why do I long for what I long for?

I cant say; we dont chose this

#### 9. Why do I read and watch what I do?

Because i identify and connect to others about these things: i cant wait to blog-talk about things i watch or read about.

#### 10. Why do I admire whom I admire?

Because they make the world better in my eyes.

#### 11. When am I happy?

Right now actually for no reason.

#### 12. Why do I have the relationships  that I have?

I am at the mercy of the people who take me as a friend.

## 2. CONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS

List your opportunities

Think small as well as big or medium,
personal as well as professional,
dreams as well as realities. 

1. people like me
2. im very string willed
3. im very brave
4. im independent
5. i love

List your core values based
on your answers to #1
Core values are your foundational beliefs,
ways to think and act that are more important
to you than anything else.

1. I like positivity 
2. I like nice people / good attitudes
3. i appreciate easy going / casual situations
4. I can be serious too
5. I like action and hard work

3. MAKE ROOM FOR WHAT YOU LOVE

Think about your purpose. What do you need more or less of to achieve it?

Refer to your answers in #1 for guidance.

Maximize ---------   Minimize

1. more cahllenge    -----   haste
2. more education  --------  less cutting of corners
3. more effort in person --- less overtly casualness 
4. more attention to detail ---- less assumtion
5. more courtesy -------- bypass niceties of everyday life

Live better every day
4. FILTER BY PURPOSE
When you’re feeling out of sorts about
what’s going on in your life, or if you’re
trying to decide if a new opportunity
fits your purpose, use these questions
to filter through to an answer.
• What core value does this fit with?
• What level of excitement do I have
about this?
• Will/does this distract from something
else that is very important to me?
• How might this play out in the future?
