Our codefellows data shows us that we can begin by studing directed and undirected graphs. where unordered vertices are bidirectional.

More closely, we should look at whare are graphs? Its just another way to store nodes of information.

- A node is called Vertex
- A connection is an edge
- the nearest conneted vertexes are called neighbors
- a degree is the ammount of edges to a vertex connections.

### There are connected, disconnected, and complete graphs.

The connection between the vetexes in a graph determines what category it falls in to:

- A connection to all vetexes to each other in one graph meana its a complete graph.

- A connected to all vetexes, even if they aren't connected each to every other males it a connected graph.

- a graph where there isint an edge connecting every vertex makes it disconnected.

### Realworld applications:

- Driving maps
- Flight mapping
- GPS
