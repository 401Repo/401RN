### Can a parent component access the state of a child component?

YEs: use a callback function

### What can be passed along in a prop variable?

from the tutorials so far i understand that props are exclusive to react and thats teh way to pass my params on down to my components:

> A common question followed by this act: how to pass the data as params (parameters) from one React component to another component? That's because you don't want to have a component rendering static data, but pass dynamic data to your component instead. That's where React's props come into play. You can pass data in React by defining custom HTML attributes to which you assign your data with JSX syntax. So don't forget the curly braces.

### How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

We can use hooks and so we can control how teh child and parent components change like (onChange or onInit) similar to Angular 

*component props*

How we pass paramenters

*component state*

The way we can monitor on what is active in our components lifecycles

*application state*

Where the app as a whole is in its lifecycle.
