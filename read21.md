>Hash tables is a data structure in which every value is associated with a key and we can find that key using hash function.

Hashtables are a great way to story data and quickly retrieve it using the keys pairing.

This losely translate to me as a great way to save time: instead of iterating thru the whole data structure like a linked list, a hashed table has the associated-array like fuctions ready to simply call on the pairings: we dont need to iterate thru all the elements when we know what keys hold thhem.
