###    Bill Sourour: The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of

When it comes to Ethics in our field we can look at the anecdotal piece by Sourour whom created a targetted marketing add that could cause people (young women in this case) to be psycologically tergetted to the financial benefit of the company regardless of their medication side effects.

Sourour did not personally assist in anyone's suicide, but he can project hismelf because of his ilvolment in the marketing of the medication, so its not fair to blame him alone on all the layers of who is involved in the negative fallback of the company that caused death and other real emotional and personal damage to the people who were negatively hit by the medication.

Sourour could have just as easily not coded the online form / app, but he still did. Him having regrets after the fact does not negate his part, and you have to own your actions, even when you regret them. Thats not to say be a martyr or not let yourself let go of mistakes, but learning that your action have consequenses and to understand before we act in our code and how it will/might impact others and own our actions then, so that we dont constantly have messes and feel sad about causing damage we could have prevented.
