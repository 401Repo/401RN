# Stack and Queues

![Express](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XWnztdhd--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_900,q_auto,w_1600/https://cl.ly/d84e17fec485/Image%25202018-09-13%2520at%252012.22.09%2520PM.png)

A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle. ... The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack. A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top. A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.

### My thoughts:

things that i learned: 

just because a queue is FIFO, it doest mean multiple paths can end a queue at multiple times: FI does not necesarily mean FO out of the whole queue... let that sink in... I visualize airport security: we get in line but multiple agents separate the people in to differnt gates and then you might go quicker or faster than people you came in behind.

stacks are just like our programs run, so that data structure doesnt make me worry about in abstraction.
