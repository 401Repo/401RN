# Reading notes: Prep: Engineering Topics 

### How to Solve Programming Problems

The main point that John Sonmez is trying to make is that we should prepare rather than jump in to avoid mistakes in technical interviews.

He uses the old "meassure twice cut once" cliche to make sure we spend more time reading over the problem to be solved and then create hard data examples to pseudo code before actually solving the problem using those reference points.

### 5 Whys

Sakichi totoya of Toyota mototrs came up with the idea of the 5 whys. This is a way to dig in to a problem and find a counter solution in 4 more layers. 

This is a great preventative way of thinking but it lays in the ability of the person employing this method to be effective: think if the person problemsolving can deduct and direct the querry correctly.
