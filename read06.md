A linked list is a "data structure" and it works as a collection of nodes that has info linking to the next mode and the information they contain. 

A double linked list is has refrences going the other way (refrerencing the nodes forward and back).

Useful for stacks and queues, and manipulating a dynamic memory for our app's objects.
