# Readings: Trees

So far in classwe have done linked list or lately stacks and queues. But with trees we have a data structure where our nodes will not be in a linear way... That being said threes and other data strucutres sometimes blur their domain lines based on their applications.

>In computer science, a Tree is defined as a hierarchical data structure which is a collection of nodes in a parent/child structure. The topmost node in a tree is called the root node. The root node acts as a parent for other nodes to which it is directly connected, and these connected nodes are called child nodes.

This tells us that jusyt like the head off a linked list, we have a root (intead for a head) that can define the befining of our tree structure for us to use to tansverse our tree.

Moments in code where we might encouter a tree is our DOM: the html is the root node, then the body and head, and the individual nodes inside:

Also Foldes and file structures like our repos.
