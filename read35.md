The ACM code is a very lengthy article of guidelines to discourage the developer-to-be from using their skills to take the skills and create a willfully harmfull impact. 

They have a whiole section addressing developers being harmful and a section contrasting in improving the comunity as a whole.

This is a similar 'first do no harm' community driven effor by the ACM to make sure not to be unethical in the implementation of the logic in applied computing to ends wich could range from fraudulent to inhumane.

My thought would be that if a computer programer is using logic to willfully tamper with the elction of 2020 by crating missinformation bots on social media they would be in violation of this code of ethics.

Just because you can do it, or because it is profitable, ultimately you are responsable for your actions.
